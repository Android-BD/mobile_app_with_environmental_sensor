# mobile_app_with_environmental_sensor
Android mobile app integrating Sensordrone environmental sensor

This is the main project I completed with my team for COP 4656: Software Development for Mobile Devices. Fall 2013. 

This was a semester long project with a three person team:
Barry Tormey
Jason Maynard
Shawn Hathaway

System design / GUI => Barry
Sensor integration => Jason 
Database integration => Shawn

The application is called iAmbiance and the purpose is to gather environmental information about various locations such as restaurants.  This environmental information is then uploaded to a social networking site.  

Key takeaway is the integration of an external environmental sensor. This project is simply a proof of concept.  These type of sensors could be used for many different applications such as chemical spills, terrorist attacks, etc. 

Please see the *.pdf and *.jpg files for a presentation overview of the project.
